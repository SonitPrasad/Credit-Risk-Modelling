# Credit-Risk-Modelling
Developed a method using statistical and machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood that a borrower will default on loan. The main objective is to estimate the Probability of default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD) to calculate the Expected Loss (EL) for the company, a core metric to manage credit risk.
